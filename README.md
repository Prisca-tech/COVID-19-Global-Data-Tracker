# COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker

A data analysis and reporting notebook (or app) that tracks global COVID-19 trends. The project will analyze cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time. It will clean and process real-world data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate insights, and visualize trends using Python data tools.

## Project Objectives:

✅ Import and clean COVID-19 global data
✅ Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
✅ Compare metrics across countries/regions
✅ Visualize trends with charts and maps
✅ Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report

## Insights and Reflections

### Key Insights

1. **Vaccination Rollout**: Belgium had the fastest vaccine rollout among the selected countries.
2. **Death Rate**: Yemen exhibited the highest death rate, indicating severe pandemic impact.
3. **Data Gaps**: Significant gaps in vaccination and testing data were observed, particularly in developing countries.
4. **Trends**: Seasonal trends in cases and deaths were identified, with peaks during colder months.

### Reflections

- The analysis highlights the importance of consistent and complete data reporting for effective pandemic management.
- Visualizations provide a clear understanding of trends and anomalies, aiding in decision-making.
- Future work could include expanding the analysis to more countries and incorporating additional datasets (e.g., economic or healthcare data).
